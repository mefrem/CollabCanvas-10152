## üìä Product Impact

### Would Designers Actually Use This?

**YES.** Here's why:

1. **Styles System**: Solves the pain of maintaining design consistency. Updating one color to update all instances is magical.

2. **Frames/Artboards**: Essential for real design work. Can't design apps without device frames. 25+ presets cover all use cases.

3. **Export**: Designers need to ship their work. PNG for marketing, SVG for developers, high-res for Retina displays.

### Cohesive User Experience

These three features create a **complete design workflow**:

1. Create frames for your target devices
2. Design with consistent styles
3. Export production-ready assets

### Differentiation from Basic Tools
